## What the Project Solves & Core Capabilities

Enterprise customer support suffers from disconnected data, slow response times, and high human agent workloads. Pravaah AI solves these issues by acting as a **stateful, autonomous routing gateway** that resolves queries immediately or escalates with detailed context:

*   **Context-Aware Dialog Memory**: Preserves customer context and `account_id` across multi-turn follow-up questions in the same chat session.
*   **Dual-Guardrail Safety Layer**: Intercepts toxic/injection inputs and verifies output grounding against retrieved documents to prevent LLM hallucinations.
*   **Intelligent Escalation**: Verifies support relevance (ignoring spam/greetings) and creates PostgreSQL support tickets only for genuine requests, generating an L2 handoff summary.
*   **Direct Telemetry Dashboard**: Provides live KPIs (ticket distribution, daily trend graphs, and active workload) and a step-by-step observability trace drawer.
*   **Voice Input Capability**: Supports live microphone transcription with a pulsing voice waveform and an interactive stop-and-edit workflow.

## ReAct Base Agent Execution Loop

Each specialized domain agent operates inside a **Reasoning and Acting (ReAct)** state loop configured to invoke database retrieval tools before deciding on a final answer.

## Technical Features & Mechanisms

### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration
Multi-agent coordination is powered by a central orchestrator. When a user submits a query, the **Central Support Orchestrator** router node reads the input and decides which agent should process it next. The graph supports multi-turn execution: if a user asks for both billing details and cancellation policy, the orchestrator routes to the CRM agent first, then to the Knowledge agent, aggregating their data in a **shared context** before formulating a single consolidated response.

### 2. Session Memory & Context Retention
Maintaining state is crucial. When a query is received:
*   A unique `session_id` is assigned or extracted.
*   The system searches the database's `audit_log` table for prior entries under that `session_id`.
*   If found, the associated `account_id` is retrieved and populated into the active state, preserving user context even if follow-up queries do not specify account numbers.
*   The conversational logs are appended to the model's history to retain full message context.

### 3. Voice Input Integration
Spoken requests are captured dynamically using the browser's native **Web Speech API**. While speaking:
*   A premium visual waveform consisting of multiple pulsing bars (`.voice-wave-bar`) animated with custom CSS keyframes is displayed.
*   The user clicks a stop toggle ("cross") to halt listening, loading the transcribed text into a `<textarea>`.
*   The user is free to review, correct typos, and click send.

### 4. Support Query Verification & Database Setup
The system connects to a **Supabase PostgreSQL** database. The database contains the following tables:
*   `accounts`: Stores seat limits, plan tiers, statuses, and monthly revenues.
*   `users`: Company owner, admin, and member account details.
*   `subscriptions`: Active contract terms and renewal timelines.
*   `invoices` & `invoice_line_items`: Details individual billing records.
*   `tickets`: Tracks support cases.
*   `audit_log`: Stores session IDs, queries, responses, and token telemetry.

To prevent database spam:
Before routing to the `escalation` node and creating a ticket row in the `tickets` table, a validation LLM verifies if the user query is a **genuine support request** (related to billing, refunds, accounts, or policies). If it is a greeting or gibberish, ticket creation is bypassed, and a polite response is returned.

## Visual Showcase

Explore the customer-facing interface and the real-time operations dashboard.

### 1. Customer Chat Workspace

The Customer Chat Workspace is a stateful, interactive portal designed to handle customer queries over multiple turns.

#### A. Chat Initial State
![Chat Initial State](./docs/screenshots/chat_initial.png)
*   **Conversational History Sidebar (Left):** Maintains a clean chronological list of past support sessions (e.g., "Billing Inquiry", "Refund Inquiry") linked to the user's active session.
*   **Stateful Memory Context:** When a user requests invoices or profile info, the system resolves historical context to retrieve their `account_id` automatically.
*   **Ticket Confirmation Alerts:** Displays clear, system-generated notification cards whenever an inquiry is escalated and a new ticket is written to the database so that the record always exists.

#### B. Voice Dictation Mode
![Voice Dictation Mode](./docs/screenshots/chat_voice_listening.png)
*   **Web Speech API Integration:** Enables live microphone recording. The status bar displays a pulsing red `REC` badge along with custom CSS-animated soundwave frequencies.
*   **Safe Edit Workflow:** Users can record their speech, press the red cancel (`X`) button to halt listening, and edit the transcribed text manually before submission.
*   **Chip Suggestions:** Provides quick-click query suggestions for common actions (e.g., querying billing history, account details, testing safety deflections).

#### C. Multi-Agent Conversation & Trace
![Chat Conversation](./docs/screenshots/chat_conversation.png)
*   **Active Agent Flow:** Displays a multi-turn session where a refund query is parsed and handled by the system.
*   **Observability Sidebar (Right):** The panel slides out to reveal the step-by-step reasoning steps of the central orchestrator (Input Guardrail status, router confidence, agent tool executions, and final response synthesis).

### 2. Operations & Telemetry Dashboard

The Operations Dashboard provides support administrators with complete real-time visibility into active workloads, AI deflection rates, and agent-level telemetry.

#### A. Telemetry Dashboard Overview
![Telemetry Dashboard Overview](./docs/screenshots/dashboard_overview.png)
*   **Interactive Period Filters:** Allows administrators to filter metrics by Today, Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, or All Time.
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    *   **Total Tickets Raised / Active / Resolved:** Live indicators pulling directly from PostgreSQL.
    *   **AI Resolution Rate:** Displays a 100% deflection rate, representing cases handled fully by autonomous agents.
*   **Telemetry Trends & Workloads:**
    *   **Incoming Daily Volume (Left):** Real-time chart displaying volumetric trends of incoming conversations vs. escalations.
    *   **Agent Workload (Right):** Visual bar chart counting invocations per specialized agent (CRM, Billing, Knowledge, etc.) to evaluate resource allocation.

#### B. Observability Trace Inspector Drawer
![Observability Trace Inspector](./docs/screenshots/observability_trace_drawer.png)
*   **Step-by-Step Execution Logs:** Displays the exact routing path taken by the orchestrator:
    1.  **Input Guardrail:** Confirms input is safe and checks for PII/injections.
    2.  **Routing Decision:** Router evaluates query and selects the CRM agent (95% confidence).
    3.  **Agent Execution:** Preview of data returned by database query tools (company info, renewal timeline, seat count, monthly revenue).
    4.  **Final Response:** Router determines CRM context is complete and routes to the final response node.

## System Evaluation & Benchmark

The platform includes an **industry-grade automated evaluation framework** located in the [`evaluation/`](./evaluation/) directory. The framework tests and benchmarks multi-agent routing decisions, factual groundedness, escalation accuracy, ticket creation/suppression behavior, latency, and token efficiency against a **100-query ground-truth dataset** derived directly from the system's database entities (`accounts.csv`, `invoices.csv`, `tickets.csv`, `users.csv`, `subscriptions.csv`, and support policy documents).

### Running the Evaluation Suite

To run the automated benchmark runner:

```bash
# Run complete 100-query benchmark
python -m evaluation.cli

# Run on a limited subset (e.g. 10 queries)
python -m evaluation.cli --limit 10

# Run evaluation for a specific domain category
python -m evaluation.cli --category crm --limit 5
python -m evaluation.cli --category billing --limit 5
python -m evaluation.cli --category conversational

# Save artifacts to a custom directory
python -m evaluation.cli --output-dir evaluation/reports/custom_run
```

Each run automatically persists timestamped artifacts in `evaluation/reports/runs/run_<timestamp>/`:
*   `summary_metrics.json`: Machine-readable KPI scores, latency percentiles, and confusion matrix.
*   `raw_results.json`: Full execution traces, actual vs. expected routing decisions, token counts, and error logs per query.
*   `evaluation_report.md`: Markdown summary report with KPI tables and breakdown.
